# TODO:
  - Setup RGB-D sensor: Need clamps and angled sensor mount 
  - Run test script and ensure action stepping works
  - Implement reseting to home pose w/joint command to compliant controller
  - Test force observations (frame, zero'ing, etc)
  - Fill in bones for gripper control and vision sensor
  - Block reaching test \ Both of these can have goal checking w/o
  - Block picking test  / needing calibrated sensors
  - Add calibrated sensor we can use to test for RL termination/reward
